<!-- This template is by default included in the HTML head section of the base Panel layout.
     To override the entire default Panel layout, create the file "layout.erb" and dodo as you like...
     Otherwise simply add scripts and stylesheet links here: -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/head.css">

<script src="/js/head.js"></script>
