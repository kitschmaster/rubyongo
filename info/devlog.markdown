not polished, but it will do.

#31.05.2018 22:05:16 CodingSession::BEGIN

#31.05.2018 19:46:01 CodingSession::END

am now preparing the panel and getting ready to start building out the rubyongo.org website with it self.

at #31.05.2018 16:50:39 the Panel UI loads nicely. right now the public folder for the Panel is inside the gem's lib folder, but ii think ii want to have the Panel's public combined with the static public, so that it can be modified by the framework user. it would be nice to be able to override, but right now ii don't see an out of box solution for having multiple public folders...

took a quick look at sinatra's handling of static file serving and it seems like it could easily be enhanced to allow multiple public folders... ii could also use [this rack middleware](https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/try_static.rb), so let's move on for now, and ii'll decide on this a bit later...

have it working at #31.05.2018 17:44:15, two public folders, the one from the user is preffered, this completes all override points. the panel can now be fully customized by the framework user.

ii can now make some plans... ii could now work on (probably in this order):

+ add ansible scripts and setup deployment commands
+ create the initial rubyongo website
+ deploy the initial rubyongo website
+ add and fixup the Mauler (MVP: be able to send emails from the deployed app)
+ finish and fixup the default theme (MVP: blog, shop, contact, about, pp, tc, sitemap)
+ add initial bitcoin payments support (MVP: generate your address, and the panel can check if payment went through)
+ add bitcoin merchant (MVP: configure a node to talk to, be able to generate addresses and confirm payments)
+ add the go backend example (MVP: jwt token authentication server and upload microservice)

ok, that's enough for a very long week(month ahead). at #31.05.2018 18:05:42 am looking at the sys scripts figuring out how to modify them for public usage. right now ii have them configured for the kitschmaster.com platform, but that platform is still private, so need to use github and that should do the trick.

so how to pull this one off. what should ii finish up first, before making the push to github?
darn, ii still need to commit my second commit. let me commit now at around #31.05.2018 18:08:33...

unfortunately, since ii upgraded Hugo yesterday, my initially developed theme is not fully functional,

running `hugo -v` reveals a bunch of warnings... and this is also a task:

+ capture output of the `hugo -v` command during publishing through the Panel UI --> Publish button.
  simply make the last result available for viewing via a link near the button.

most of the warnings are of this type: "Unable to locate layout for ...".
so am thinking ii need to revise and compare my theme with a newer one.

after some reading around, ii simply added this line to the config.toml:

    theme = "default"

and now the rendering worked.

am down to 3 warnings, which ii can resolve later:

WARN 2018/05/31 18:29:56 No translation bundle found for default language "en"
WARN 2018/05/31 18:29:56 Translation func for language en not found, use default.
WARN 2018/05/31 18:29:56 i18n not initialized, check that you have language file (in i18n) that matches the site language or the default language.

+ add language support to the backend?

let me check if the site works, and then do the commit dance.

ii have the first post. that should do it.

still editing details for the second commit... it's already at #31.05.2018 19:04:00.

ii should stop here and take a break until tomorrow.

second commit done, and another one to fix my typos...

and another one for a good measure.

ii also wrote this, but then deleted it from the README:

Ruby On Go can also serve dynamic content and run your microservices. Choose your favourite JS frontend framework, build your UI, create a Hugo theme with it and throw that into a Ruby On Go `theme` folder, deploy it to a cheap host, and then edit the content via the Panel UI, or let the owner edit the content by him self... get a small percentage from the bitcoin sales from each shop you create and job well done for everyone.

Coding... here's the current workflow when setting up a new site:

  `rog new my_new_site`
  `cd my_new_site`
  `rake test`
  `rog s` # start panel
  `hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL="http://192.168.1.111/"` # start static server

there is now a `gen` folder containing: Gemfile, Rakefile and example tests, all of which is copied into the new site.

so more or less, things are ready for basic development. now need to verify the panel works and settings are picked up and so forth...

should the command `rog start` also run the hugo static server? let's see how this would work in practice.

ii went with an additional command `rog h` to start up the hugo server...

Code reloading works, panel code can be overriden. Setting up the panel views...

Testing... have a small problem testing Guru creation - guessing a development DB needs to be setup...
The Guru is a DataMapper::Resource, so let's see...

The DB is currently set up with: `DataMapper.setup(:default, "sqlite://#{EXEC_PATH}/db.sqlite")`

Let's see what this path is during test. Yup it's fine: `sqlite:///Users/mihael/opensource/rubyongo/db.sqlite`
But still, when running this:

    guru = Rubyongo::Guru.first(:username => 'guru')

a nil is returned. Which is correct, since the default user is created from the config file, and there we have 'rubyongo' as the username. So seems like it already works, the question is, should there be a development DB with a different username/pass...

Well, there has to be a way to test the framework code and a way to test the framework user's code.

yup, there was.

#22.05.2018 12:54:55 CodingSession::BEGIN

#16.05.2018 18:55:04 CodingSession::END

coding all over, mostly just moving code around to make it work like a gem...

#16.05.2018 13:52:32 CodingSession::BEGIN

#15.05.2018 12:55:04 CodingSession::END

coding... took the initial code ii had built as a working prototype (used to deploy and edit http://atejas.org). And am now rewriting/rewiring it to be a gem.

ii will push to github.com/kitschmaster/rubyongo, but only after ii get the spinpaintings.shop setup with it.

#15.05.2018 09:52:32 CodingSession::BEGIN

#14.05.2018 12:11:10 ComSession::END

freaking month went by before ii took the chance and shot the paintings.

but ii now have the content, finally. ii ended up avoiding the shooting and doing so many other things.

ii have to make an over the spinning wheel setup. so ii can shoot the image while spinning. and forget about the photography studio.

taking super nice images of 59 paintings took the whole morning. and then one more afternoon to edit and cut out perfect rectangles from the analog images.

and now at #14.05.2018 10:48:12 ii realise ii did not edit 25 images at least. so doing it now...

getting back at the machine is so hard in these sunny days. little by little, and it'll get there.

never surrender.

the quality of the images is not very good. ii was shooting with a Canon PowerShot SX130IS. it's rated 12.1 mega pixels. lol

anyway, ii now want to build a real shop.

but ii want to document the steps this time.

and whilst ii document see what can be improved.

it is good ii did not touch the code for a long time.

ii now have the fresh mind and can critique my old code.

but first thing is first. kit.org does not sound well.

and so "Ruby On Go" was born. whooohooo!

and now let's see how ROG works. and let's also improve and inovate along the way...

one day ii should write an article on atejas.org with the title: atejas dam na rog?

how does google translate: "a te jas dam na rog?"

today ii bought rubyongo.org, and spinpaintings.shop for $16.90.

better make it happen now. :)

at #14.05.2018 11:25:36 ii have all 59 images edited to 1850x1850px.

right now the sys part of rog is not included in the repository. but we need it for any serious open sourcing.

just need to keep credentials out of it first. so that's a task:

+ move any credentials out of the repo.
 - sys/keys contains credentials.

#the ansible scripts

## roginit

after buying the domain, one can run the init script included in the sys folder.

name="$1@$2"
repo="$2"

`roginit rubyongo@rubyongo.org`

where repo equals "rubyongo.org".

this will then do the following:

1. check if `keys\rubyongo@rubyongo.org` already exists, and if so, stop
2. since the above key is not found, a ssh connection is made to the supplied argument and the folder `~/.ssh` is established and set up for ssh-access with your local`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` copied to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.
3. on the remote machine a ssh key is generated and
4. then the public part is fetched down locally and saved in the `keys` folder

have to run...

#14.05.2018 09:59:14 ComSession::BEGIN

#14.04.2018 08:28:59 ComSession::END

time is flying. ii have to cut down on some of the ideas and just start pushing through.

ii have setup a small DIY product shooting spot in my office
to create the content for the following two shops:

1. Potters paintings - spin paintings
2. Soƒça riverbed stone incense burners

need to generate a bitcoin address for each item.

also need to get the codebase into a documented state...

renamed the project from kit.org to kit/org. but today ii am renaming it to kitorg, for easy typing.

#14.04.2018 07:51:36 ComSession::BEGIN

#07.03.2018 12:10:31 ComSession::END

it seems like ii will have to run a full node, in order to be able to accept payments for any shop built with kit/org.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81h1oy/the_merchants_guide_to_accepting_bitcoin_directly/

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Lazy_API

#07.03.2018 10:10:25 ComSession::BEGIN

#05.03.2018 22:33:24 ComSession::END

let's say there's an item archetype:

+++
weight = ""
measures = ""
sku = ""
title = ""
date = ""
description = ""
author = ""
price = ""
shipping_price = ""
tax = ""
quantity = 1
assets = []
tags = []
categories = []
+++

now we want to automate the creation of this.

by writing the above it should be possible to create a form from it.

and then this form can be shown in the UI, for any device.

then artist uploads an image and fills out the rest and hits the sendit button.

a folder with the date is created and content .md file is created within, plus the assets are moved into.

this is not yet published? or should it be published? no it should not, so that QA can be done.
therefor after creating take the artist straigth to preview, and let him edit until he hits the publish button.

btw, just think about the framework name, or the VIP name. sin at ra. the ra worshippers build our frameworks. how hard is it to write a ruby Rack enabled server... it's too easy, and the code is open, so let's sin at ra.

gem install sinatra-contrib to get extras, like `config_file 'config.yml'`

not using `require_relative 'atejas'` inside config.ru
